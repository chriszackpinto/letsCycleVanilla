Where's the best place for a great cycling experience? The beach!

However, it's next to impossible to ride during a high tide!

Here's a quick way to check the tide and if the weather is suitable for a fun ride

PS:

~~I exhausted the TIDE api's 100 requests during testing, and you've gotta take my word that it's awesome~~

It ~~just~~ mentions High/Low Tide along with the Tidal Timing **and** Weather along with Wind Speed and Direction!


- [x] **Switch API** (50/day limit)
- [ ] Update UI - Currently basic since focused on functionality
