Where's the best place for a great cycling experience? The beach!

You have the whole world on one side and nothing but the open sea and sky on the other! This, along with the constant breeze is quite a unique experience!

However, it's next to impossible to ride during a high tide!

Here's a quick way to check the tide and if the weather is suitable for a fun ride

PS:

~~I exhausted the TIDE api's 100 requests during testing, and you've gotta take my word that it's awesome~~

It ~~just~~ mentions High/Low Tide along with the Tidal Timing **and** Weather along with Wind Speed and Direction!

Added Chart.js, and got rid of the icons

To do:

- [x] **Switch API** (50/day limit)
- [x] Update UI ~~Currently basic since focused on functionality~~
